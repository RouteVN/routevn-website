## Team Member Introduction: Nghia

Nghia joined RouteVN as an intern from late 2025 until January 2026. During his time here, he has made significant contributions to RouteVN.

### About Nghia

Nghia is a software engineering student from Vietnam. He is always eager to learn new technologies and loves collaborating with teams.

One of his projects outside of RouteVN is the [Limbus ID Creator](https://limbus-company-id-creator.netlify.app/), which helps people create their own original characters inspired by Limbus Company. This project allowed him to make friends from all over the world. It features both backend and frontend development and was the first project that truly solved a real problem and reached thousands of users.

### Experience with Visual Novels

Nghia's experience with visual novels started recently. Some of his favorites:

- Umineko
- Zero Escape series (999, Virtue's Last Reward, Zero Time Dilemma)
- Danganronpa
- AI: The Somnium Files
- Limbus Company
- Reverse: 1999
- Arknights


### Contributions at RouteVN

Nghia's biggest contribution was rewriting route-graphics. He successfully rewrote the library from scratch, achieving the goals of making it maintainable, reducing bugs, and supporting advanced features.

Other than that, he has also made many improvements and critical bug fixes on RouteVN Client and Route Engine.

The team is grateful for all of Nghia's contributions during his time at RouteVN. We wish him all the best in his future adventures!
