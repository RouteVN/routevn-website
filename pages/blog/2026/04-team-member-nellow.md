## Team Member Introduction: Nellow

Nellow joined RouteVN as an intern from late 2025 until the end of January 2026. During his time here, he made valuable contributions to RouteVN.

### About Nellow

Nellow is a high school student from Nepal. He is a teenager who loves exploring new things and making video games. He has been prototyping games since childhood and also enjoys web development.

He has also participated in several game jams, gaining experience in game development:

- **VHS** - Kathmandu University Computer Club Game Jam, July 2024. Worked on concept, design, and implementation. The game won first position, demonstrating creativity and technical execution under strict time pressure. [Play](https://nellow-protfolio.netlify.app/projects/vhs)

- **Canno Shot** - Dark Matter Game Jam, 2024. Designed and implemented physics-based projectile mechanics. Created the core gameplay loop around cannon shooting and handling complex collision physics. One of the best overall game submissions.

### Experience with Visual Novels

Nellow's journey with visual novels began with his love for visual novels and light novels. He wanted to create his own VN but never had the chance until joining RouteVN, which he saw as an opportunity to fulfill his hobby as a game developer and improve his experience.

Some of the Visual Novels he played:
- Finding Cinderella
- Fate/stay Night

He once collaborated with a creator on making a personal visual novel using Unity, though the project was put on hold for various reasons.

### Contributions at RouteVN

Nellow brought his passion for game development and fresh perspective as someone genuinely interested in creating a visual novel.

He has contributed several feature enhancements and bug fixes to Route Engine.

His biggest contributions were on RouteVN Creator. During January, RouteVN Creator became much more stable and usable because of his relentless work.
