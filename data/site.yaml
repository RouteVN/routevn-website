      title: Frequently Asked Questions
      items:
        - title: What makes RouteVN Creator different from other Visual Novel engines?
          content: No coding, no technical background required. We built RouteVN Creator so anyone, including writers, artists, and hobbyists, can create their own Visual Novel. Easy to start, and stays organized as your project grows.
        - title: Will RouteVN Creator always stay free?
          content: Yes, the free version will always be free and open source. We may add paid features in the future, but they will be optional and won't limit the free version.
        - title: How do I export my Visual Novel?
          content: Currently, you can export your project as a web version (HTML and JS files). We plan to support all major platforms soon, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
        - title: Are there any content restrictions?
          content: RouteVN Creator is just a tool. You can create whatever you want. The app works offline, so we have no way of knowing what you make.
        - title: What are the limitations of RouteVN Creator?
          content: RouteVN Creator is best for relatively simple Visual Novels without complex gameplay. It may not be suitable if you need custom game mechanics or advanced features uncommon in Visual Novels.
